## NOTE
Please check the instructions to run this project at the end of this file.

## Description

We want you to implement a REST API endpoint that given a list of products, applies some discounts to them and can be filtered.

You are free to choose whatever language and tools you are most comfortable with. Please add instructions on how to run it and publish it in Github.

## What we expect

- Code structure/architecture must fit this use case, as simple or as complex needed to complete what is asked for.
- Test are a must. Code must be testable without requiring networking or the filesystem. Tests should be runnable with 1 command.
- The project must be runnable with 1 simple command from any machine.
- Explanations on decisions taken

## Given this list of products:
```
{
    "products": [
        {
            "sku": "000001",
            "name": "BV Lean leather ankle boots",
            "category": "boots",
            "price": 89000
        },
        {
            "sku": "000002",
            "name": "BV Lean leather ankle boots",
            "category": "boots",
            "price": 99000
        },
        {
            "sku": "000003",
            "name": "Ashlington leather ankle boots",
            "category": "boots",
            "price": 71000
        },
        {
            "sku": "000004",
            "name": "Naima embellished suede sandals",
            "category": "sandals",
            "price": 79500
        },
        {
            "sku": "000005",
            "name": "Nathane leather sneakers",
            "category": "sneakers",
            "price": 59000
        }
    ]
}
```

You must take into account that this list could grow to have 20.000 products.

The prices are integers for example, 100.00â‚¬ would be 10000 .

You can store the products as you see fit (json file, in memory, rdbms of choice)

## Given that:

Products in the boots category have a 30% discount.

The product with sku = 000003 has a 15% discount.

When multiple discounts collide, the bigger discount must be applied.

## Provide a single endpoint
```
GET /products
```

- Can be filtered by category as a query string parameter

- (optional) Can be filtered by priceLessThan as a query string parameter, this filter applies before discounts are applied and will show products with prices
lesser than or equal the value provided.

- Returns a list of Product with the given discounts applied when necessary
- Must return at most 5 elements. (The order does not matter)

## Product model
- price.currency is always EUR

- When a product does not have a discount, price.final and price.original should be the same number and discount_percentage should be null.

- When a product has a discount price.original is the original price, price.final is the amount with the discount applied and discount_percentage
represents the applied discount with the % sign.

## Example product with a discount of 30% applied.
```
{
    "sku": "000001",
    "name": "BV Lean leather ankle boots",
    "category": "boots",
    "price": {
        "original": 89000,
        "final": 62300,
        "discount_percentage": "30%",
        "currency": "EUR"
    }
}
```

## Example product without a discount
```
{
    "sku": "000001",
    "name": "BV Lean leather ankle boots",
    "category": "boots",
    "price": {
        "original": 89000,
        "final": 89000,
        "discount_percentage": null,
        "currency": "EUR"
    }
}
```

## HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
Here are two ways to run this project, with or withour Docker:

### With DOCKER

1) Clone [repository](git@github.com:aorizzuto/mytheresa.git) to path "pathOrigin" where you want to clone the repository and make the clone, then choose a name for the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:aorizzuto/mytheresa.git
```
2) Move it to the folder created
```
cd <pathOrigin>/<name-of-repository>
```
3) Run following command to expose 8080, if you want to expose other port you can change the first 8080:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it $(docker build -q .)
```
4) You can use the postman_collection.json (included in this project) to make the requests or create your own requests

### Without DOCKER
1) Execute first three steps mentioned above
2) Run following command:
```
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=local build/libs/challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```
3) You can use the postman_collection.json (included in this project) to make the requests or create your own requests

## HOW TO RUN THE TESTS
1) After steps 1 and 2 mentioned above, run the following command:
```
./gradlew test
```

2) You will receive a report like this:
```
com.mytheresa.challenge.service.DiscountServiceTest

  Test GIVEN product with SKU!=3 WHEN applied SKU=3 discount THEN not applied() PASSED
  Test GIVEN product with SKU=3 WHEN applied SKU=3 discount THEN applied() PASSED
  Test GIVEN product without category discount WHEN applied category discount THEN applied() PASSED
  Test GIVEN product with SKU!=3 and not category discount WHEN applied both discounts THEN apply none() PASSED
  Test GIVEN product with SKU=3 and category discount WHEN applied both discounts THEN apply greater one() PASSED
  Test GIVEN product with category discount WHEN applied category discount THEN applied() PASSED
```
